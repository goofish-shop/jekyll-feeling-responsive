As part of the Hornets' Re!magine Spectrum Center project, the centre will feature over 160,000 square feet (14,864 square metres) of training, administrative, and retail space.

The linear building will be composed of bands of metal panels and glass, forming horizontal lines that will be broken by wedge-shaped angled panels.

"A dynamic swarm"

"Elevated above the city streets of downtown Charlotte, the training floors are clad in a dynamic swarm of articulated metal panels – the composition highlighted by an array of sloped iridescent accent panels," Mallie told Dezeen.

"We incorporated the Hornets' coloration and branding into our design thinking, uniquely tying the architecture to the team and the city."

Apt for a venue in a place nicknamed Buzz City, the bee-themed branding will continue in the main double-court gymnasium with hexagon-tiled panels between glassed offices where spectators can watch practice.

The space will be decked out in the Hornets' signature teal and dark purple and is lit by a clerestory window that wraps around the space and draws light across the trussed ceiling.

Kitty-corner to the Spectrum Center – on the corner of Caldwell and 5th Streets – the performance centre will have a public plaza on the ground floor that will filter into an atrium-like gathering space directly above it inside the building.

The remainder of the ground floor includes 2,500 square feet (232 square metres) of retail space that allows the public to engage with the building.
