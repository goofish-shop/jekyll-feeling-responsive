Liam Payne had multiple recreational drugs in his system at the time of his tragic death last week, a toxicology report has revealed.

According to an ABC News report, the late One Direction singer had substances in his body including “pink cocaine” — a cocktail of drugs typically including ketamine, MDMA, methamphetamine, and more — as well as cocaine, benzodiazepine, and crack. A makeshift aluminum pipe for taking drugs was also found in his hotel room.

Just minutes before Payne fell to his death from a balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Wednesday (October 16th), a hotel manager made an emergency call out of concern for an “aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol.” Believing Payne’s life was at risk, the manager added, “When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone.”

A preliminary autopsy report from the Argentinian Public Prosecutor’s Office has found Payne died from “multiple traumas” and “internal and external bleeding” as a result of his fall from the third floor of the building.

In the wake of his death, TMZ was widely criticized for publishing a cropped photo of Payne’s body, which was then removed from the site without explanation.

Numerous celebrities have spoken out about the music industry failing the young artist, who was 31 at the time of his death. Notably, Bruce Springsteen said the business puts “enormous pressures on young people,” with Sharon Osbourne, Robbie Williams, and Payne’s fellow X Factor contestants Katie Waissel and Rebecca Ferguson raising similar concerns.
