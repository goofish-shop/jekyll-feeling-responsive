			<p>LABAN NYARIT, Indonesia — Ipu Angit’s close relationship with the forest here in the interior of Borneo is evident as he identifies the plants and trees he uses to meet his daily needs, venturing deeper in despite the hot, humid weather and his advanced age.</p>

<p>One moment he deftly fashions a makeshift umbrella out of palm leaves. The next he points out some young rattan stems, which he often prepares to eat by boiling to reduce the bitterness and then either cooking them with turmeric or eating them raw.</p>

<p>Lately, however, Ipu has been clouded by anxiety: the rainforest he calls home appears set to be demolished for wood pellet production by a coal company seeking to pivot to “green” energy.</p>

<p>“If this forest disappeared, where would we find these things?” Ipu asks. “This is what keeps the Punan people alive.”</p>

<p>Indonesia is the world’s fourth-most-populous country and a top greenhouse gas emitter, with nearly half its energy coming from coal.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/10/16091104/20231117D2_DJI_0955-768x512.jpg" /></p>

<p>As the nation strives to make good on its pledges to cut fossil fuels, President Joko Widodo has promoted biomass energy, derived from burning plant and animal products, as a sustainable alternative. His administration, whose term came to an end on Oct. 20, has set ambitious targets to increase the burning of biomass alongside coal in power plants, a method known as cofiring, which is used extensively in Japan and South Korea.</p>

<p>PT Malinau Hijau Lestari (MHL), the company seeking to operate in Ipu’s village, Laban Nyarit, is one of many firms in Indonesia lining up to establish plantations of fast-growing tree species to produce wood pellets as biomass, classified by the government as a form of renewable energy. Indonesia’s wood pellets are slated for both domestic use and export to other countries.</p>

<p>Fears abound, however, that Indonesia’s biomass drive might come at the expense of its abundant but dwindling rainforests. A 2022 analysis by clean energy think tank Trend Asia concluded that meeting the government’s target to increase the portion of biomass burned in coal plants to 10% would require clearing at least 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of natural forest, an area twice the size of the island of Bali, in order to free up land for new plantations.</p>

<p>Indonesia’s state electricity utility, PLN, has said there’s ample unforested land available for new biomass estates. But deforestation for biomass has already emerged in Indonesia’s Papua region, where the billionaire-owned Medco conglomerate is bulldozing a rainforest for a wood plantation to supply a power plant it’s building, and on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where a pair of palm oil companies that recently had their permits revoked have subsequently begun clearing rainforest in order to harvest wood pellets for export.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/10/16085523/20231114D1_DJI_0364-768x512.jpg" /></p>

<p>After Mongabay received a tip that MHL had approached Ipu Angit’s village and three neighboring communities to acquire their lands for its own biomass energy venture, we traveled to the area to investigate.</p>

<p>The four villages are located in Malinau, a heavily forested district in North Kalimantan province that borders Malaysia’s Sarawak state on the giant island of Borneo. Malinau is larger than the U.S. state of Maryland but home to just 85,000 people, most of them Indigenous Dayaks.</p>

<p>Three of the villages — Laban Nyarit, Nunuk Tanah Kibang and Sengayan — have already signed over to MHL a total of at least 5,000 hectares (12,400 acres) for its biomass plantation, local residents and officials told us. Local leaders in a fourth village, Long Loreh, said their community had so far refused the company’s advances.</p>

<p>While MHL’s permits aren’t publicly available, Mongabay did obtain maps of its land concession from villagers who had received them directly from company officials. An analysis of the maps by the NGO Forest Watch Indonesia found that the concession covers 19,045 hectares (47,061 acres) — about twice the size of Paris — including around 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of standing rainforest, although it remains unclear how far MHL has advanced through the licensing process and whether the maps are final.</p>
